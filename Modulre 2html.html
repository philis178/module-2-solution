<h1>Our Menu</h1>

			<span id='pp1'>Chicken</span>
				<p>For as long as I can recollect, I have consistently preferred going out to eat. Two of my preferred cafés are Gloria Jean's and McDonald's. Despite the fact that both are spots to feast they have their disparities in their mood, pausing, and cost. When choosing where to go to eat, I have three things to consider. I should consider the climate or where I need to go to. The measure of time I have is another thought. The measure of cash that I am ready to spend is a major impact.
